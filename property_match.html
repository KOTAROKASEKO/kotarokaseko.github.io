    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>{{APP_NAME}}</strong></p>
    <p><em>Effective date:</em> October 1, 2025</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      {{APP_NAME}} (“we”, “us”, or “our”) provides a mobile application that allows users to chat, post property listings, and share certain personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, when we disclose it, and the choices and rights available to users.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1. Information you provide directly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account details:</strong> name, email address, username, password (hashed), profile photo.</li>
      <li><strong>Property listings:</strong> property title, address, description, photos, price, contact preferences, and any fields entered when posting a listing.</li>
      <li><strong>Chat messages:</strong> messages and attachments you send to other users.</li>
      <li><strong>Support requests:</strong> messages, email correspondence, and other information you provide when contacting support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Device & Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We automatically collect data about how you access and use the app, such as device model, OS version, app version, IP address, timestamps, and crash logs.</p>

    <h3>3. Location and Media</h3>
    <p>If you choose to include location in a property listing or upload photos/videos, we collect those. Location is optional and only collected when you explicitly allow it.</p>

    <h3>4. Microphone / Voice Recording</h3>
    <p>
      If the app offers voice messages or voice-based features, the app will request permission to use the device microphone. We only record audio when you explicitly start a voice recording action (user-initiated). The app does not record audio in the background or without your clear action and consent.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use information to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the app features (chat, posting and managing property listings).</li>
      <li>Deliver voice message functionality when you record and send audio.</li>
      <li>Enable profile management and contact between users.</li>
      <li>Improve, maintain, and analyze the app (analytics, crash reporting).</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We may share data in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With other users:</strong> Content you post publicly (property listings, profile, chat messages with other users) will be visible to intended recipients and other users as designed by the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third-party providers who perform services for us (hosting, analytics, messaging, payment processors). We require these providers to protect your data and use it only for the services provided.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> When required by law, or to protect rights, safety or property.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction under appropriate protections.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> We will <em>not</em> sell your personal information for direct monetary gain.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal data as long as necessary to provide the services, for the period described in our internal retention schedule, or as required to comply with legal obligations. If you delete your account, we will remove visible personal data promptly but may retain backups or aggregated data for a limited time (typically up to 90 days) to meet operational or legal requirements.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the data we hold. Examples include encrypted connections (HTTPS), hashed passwords, access controls, and regular security reviews. However, no system is fully secure — we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>User Controls & Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access: request a copy of personal data we hold about you.</li>
      <li>Correction: request corrections to inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
      <li>Deletion: request deletion of your personal data (subject to legal exceptions).</li>
      <li>Portability: obtain a machine-readable copy of your data.</li>
      <li>Restrict processing or object to certain processing activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:{{CONTACT_EMAIL}}">{{CONTACT_EMAIL}}</a>. We may need to verify your identity before acting on certain requests.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the applicable age without parental consent. If you believe we have collected such data, contact us to request deletion.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Cookies & Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to operate and improve the service, for analytics, and for security. For mobile apps, similar identifiers (advertising ID, device identifiers) may be used instead of browser cookies.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-Party Services & Links</h2>
    <p>The app may use third-party services (e.g., analytics, cloud storage, messaging, authentication). These third parties have their own privacy policies — we recommend reviewing them. The app may also contain links to other sites; we are not responsible for their privacy practices.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed in countries outside your own where our servers or service providers are located. We will take appropriate steps to protect your data when transferring it internationally, consistent with applicable law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, operational, or regulatory reasons. When we make material changes, we will update the “Effective date” above and may provide additional notice within the app.</p>
  </section>
